<p>I'm passionate about everything digital. I love developing applications using various types of technology. For web development WordPress, Opencart, Drupal, Expression Engine and Magento are the primary platforms that I use as content management systems but am always looking for new and better ways of creating.
</p>

<p>With over 10 years of commercial web development experience, I have gained a very good understanding of how to take web applications from concept to completion. The goal with every project is to improve a clients online presence whether that means increasing profits or increasing their findability in search engines.
